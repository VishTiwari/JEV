I am pleased to acknowledge Prof.Keith O’Hara for his invaluable guidance during the course of this project work.

The program utilizes C to create a text editor in your terminal. On a fundamental level it recognizes the user's keystrokes and can open, save, and close files. It also has cool features such as searching, syntax highlighting, scrolling, bolding, and copy and paste!
 All users have to do is choose/create a .txt, .C, .java, or .py to work. They can view the details of their file using the status bar at the bottom of the screen, and they will be constantly assisted by their virtual assistant “JEV”.  For example, exiting the programming without saving will prompt JEV to speak up. 
This is an important problem as a lot of text editors like Notepad, TextEdit, and Nano do not allow you to do certain things. Our program is more user friendly because its personalized prompts prevent the user from accidentally deleting files. Additionally, it allows a copy, paste, and bold ability that nano does not. This is definitely a step forward compared to the other text editors out there. 
I was confident I could create a text editor, but I knew it would be a difficult task. Big software companies and developers spend a lot of money and time trying to create solid text editors but if I could create a simple one that felt more user friendly then that would be a success. 

Scope for further investigation:

-Letting the user choose what color they want the program to be
-Displaying a goodbye message as you close the program
-Adding an italics option
-Fix portability issues
